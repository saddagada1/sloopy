# Itinerary

- Make responsive (currently only supports mobile)
- Optimize database reads and writes
- Rework NextAuth to take load off database
- Optimistically update mutations and use react-query cache more if possible
- Cleanup Components

# Oversights

- Forgetting to add tuning to sloops so they can be made for tracks outside of standard tuning (completely slipped my mind)
- Creating my own ui library (really good experience but not really efficient)
- Not factoring out more components (copy & paste is a really bad habit)
